    # you can use:
    objs = idf.idfobjects['ElectricEquipment']

    objs = idf.idfobjects['ElectricEquipment'.upper()]
    
2019-06-02
----------

- Fixes the TypeError
    - 'TypeError: can only concatenate list (not "dict_keys") to list' is fixed

2019-05-27
----------

- fixed issue # 238
    - **Problem:** if the IDF object has more fileds than that in the IDD file, eppy will truncate the object and will give no warning.
    - **Solution:** eppy should throw an exception to warn the user that the IDF file is not readable without changing the IDD file. 
    - The exception message will the text that has to be added to the IDD file, so that it works correctly.

- added a script that can compare two idf files. It is documented in "Useful Scripts". The script is in 
    - eppy/usefull_scripts/idfdiff.py
- added two scripts that test if eppy works when new versions of energyplus are released. Documentation for this is not yet done. The scripts are
