SizingPeriod:DesignDay,
      \memo The design day object creates the parameters for the program to create
      \memo the 24 hour weather profile that can be used for sizing as well as
      \memo running to test the other simulation parameters. Parameters in this
      \memo include a date (month and day), a day type (which uses the appropriate
      \memo schedules for either sizing or simple tests), min/max temperatures,
      \memo wind speeds, and solar radiation values.
  A1, \field Name
       \type alpha
       \required-field
       \reference DesignDays
       \reference RunPeriodsAndDesignDays

field A1 is of type alpha

SizingPeriod:WeatherFileConditionType,
       \memo Use a weather file period for design sizing calculations.
       \memo EPW weather files are created with typical and extreme periods
       \memo created heuristically from the weather file data.  For more
       \memo details on these periods, see AuxiliaryPrograms document.

Object: BuildingSurface:Detailed
field:   N2 , \field Number of Vertices
    No type is indicated in idd version 7.0
    Should be of type integer.
    
html table output should have tags for easy searching
TODO : give more detailed specs for this
